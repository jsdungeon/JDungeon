# JDungeon
The JAVA Dungeon
This is the JAVA version of the Dungeon Of Doom.

The first step is to create a 3*3 maze where the player can move around by being displayed the rooms where to go and to enter one of the possible room numbers.
The next step will be to add room descriptions and to place items into them.
The player needs to get an inventory where to place collected items. The player needs to get some stats like health as well.
A "wield" functionality has to be added. Weapons and armory functionality has to be added.
Enemies and NPCs have to be added.
In a far future multiplayer has to be added.
The game should be ported to androis as well.

Have fun watching it grow and participate if you would like to :-)
Cheers
